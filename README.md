# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Classifiers

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project for breast cancer detection using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset. The project demonstrates how machine learning can assist in early breast cancer detection by analyzing cell nucleus characteristics to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## Dataset Description

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset contains:
- **569 instances** (212 malignant, 357 benign)
- **30 numeric features** computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses
- Features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images including:
  - Radius
  - Texture
  - Perimeter
  - Area
  - Smoothness
  - Compactness
  - Concavity
  - Symmetry
  - Fractal dimension
- **Target variable**: Binary classification (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)

## Key Features

- Comprehensive data exploration and visualization
- Feature analysis and selection
- Implementation of multiple machine learning classifiers
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Detailed Jupyter notebook with step-by-step explanations
- Potential for integration with medical diagnostic systems
